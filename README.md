## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m YASSIN TAGHI
Iâ€™m a software developer who enjoys building things that people actually use. I created Textiar, a platform where anyone can share knowledge and personal insights in a simple text-based format. I like working with Python and Django, and Iâ€™m always curious about how technology can make life a little simpler.

**I Mostly Code in Python**
